# 6 DoF Robot Arm Matlab and Arduino
This project is made by G.C Niu in 2017. The goal of this project is to design a forward 6 DoF robotic arm and control it by Matlab. The controller is separated by two parts, i.e. Matlab and Arduino. We will firstly set the listening port of Arduino. And the message will send to the corresponding port. The tutorial can be easily found in CSDN blog. The following figure is the Matlab GUI. It can control the 6 servos and thow something away.
